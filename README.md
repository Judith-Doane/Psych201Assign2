# Psych201Assign4

  A topic that I have been revisiting lately, as part of my educational pursuits, is neuroscience. It is something that I have focused on before within my fields of study, nursing and psychology. I really enjoy the brain because, although we know some about its anatomy, most of what goes on within the brain is out of our knowledge. I have been revisiting this, while I take some lower-level courses this semester, which has proved to have been a more than necessary review. I am excited to see what the rest of this semester brings.
